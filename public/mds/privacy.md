There are also a few ad hoc cases where EU personal data may be transferred to the U.S. in connection with DJQR operations, for instance, if an EU user signs up for our newsletter, participates in one of our surveys, or purchases swag from our online store. Such transfers are only occasional and data is transferred under the [Article 49(1)(b) derogation](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-49-gdpr/) under GDPR and the UK version of GDPR.

## Changes and Questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify users.
