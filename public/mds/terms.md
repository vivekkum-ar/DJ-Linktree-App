# Terms of Service

*Last updated: 01/02/2025*

From everyone at DJQR, thank you for using our products! We build them to help you manage and share your digital presence efficiently. Because we don’t know every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to ensure a smooth experience for everyone.

When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to DJQR Technologies.

When we say “Services”, we mean our website (djqr.com) and any product created and maintained by DJQR Technologies, including our web and mobile applications.

When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.

We may update these Terms of Service (“Terms”) in the future. You can track all changes on our website. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and notify account holders as appropriate.

By using our Services, you agree to the latest Terms. If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account.
